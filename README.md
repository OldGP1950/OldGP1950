- 👋 Hi, I’m @OldGP1950
- 👀 I’m interested in learning statistics from the ground up, but mathematics is not my strong suit...
- 🌱 I’m currently learning basic material which I then hope to use in a clinical setting...
- 💞️ I’m not yet ready to collaborate, but when I am, it will be with colleagues working in biostatistics...
- 📫 How to reach me: I am faculty with the Renaissance School of Medicine at Stony Brook University; email is louis.verardo@stonybrookmedicine.edu
